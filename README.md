# Reinforcement Learning Projects
This is a repository of some of the reinforcement leanring projects I've done.
<br/><br/>

## Temporal Difference Learning
The goal of this project is to replicate the random walk experiment in section 3.2 of Sutton (1988).
<br/><br/>

## Lunar Lander
In this project, I attempt to solve the [Lunear Lander](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/box2d/lunar_lander.py) problem using Deep Q-Network (Minh et al 2013).
<br/><br/>

## Correlated-Q
The goal of this project is to replicate the soccer game experiment in section of Greenwald and Hall (2003)
<br/><br/>
